I hope nobody actually needs to be told this, but: odds of someone catching the coronavirus from American/Canadian Chinese restaurants are about as slim as catching it from literally anyone else here. The idea that people should avoid them is not only unfair but fucking asinine.

@AmyKremer @realDonaldTrump So Trump blaming the media for causing a panic is less ridiculous than you thinking we‚Äôre all gonna die now..? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è you have to understand, left, that kind of logic is why we‚Äôre tired of your shit and a fucking communist is leading your party. #coronavirus #covid19

Current irony:  According to data coming from NY, #AsianAmericans comprise only FOUR percent (4%) of all cases, making this very vilified group the least responsible for transferring or getting #coronavirus. #Hateisavirus https://t.co/1rq1SDB9Uo

I would especially urge my fellow Jewish friends in the US to patronise their local Chinese restaurants/takeouts EXTRA atm. American Jews have a historic special bond with American Chinese food places. We need to help counteract this racist &amp; ignorant paranoia re: coronavirus

@BBCBreaking Even today @ 50 countries infected with China Wuhan coronavirus exports &amp; people dying every day WHO STILL refuses to call for travel bans against major infected countries and call it a pandemic! Entire WHO leadership should be PROSECUED for criminal negligence against humanity.

@GadSaad We have to blame CCP and WHO for this #CCPVirus shit.

@gabewildau It's called preventative actions. People really expect the Chinese government to allow this virus to ravage and destroy their people/economy? People are fucking delusional with this anti China bashing. Time to look in the mirror.

@RickMcCargar @jeffsessions @99freemind It's just a coincidence that all these countries were in Wuhan right around when the virus broke and all those countries being there is just coincidental in the spread. And any talk is "Chinese propaganda" but we're basing our #MedicalMartialLaw on the same country's info.

100% Correct. I completely trust the CCP. Never known a communist dictatorship to ever fib.

@DailyCaller Dr. Birx: common Chinese people didn't know there was human-to-human transmission till Jan 18th. Chinese government informed US even earlier than common Chinese people. No excuse for virus spreading in America.

@Brian06176510 @tribelaw @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity @JudgeJeanine who is "they"? I haven't heard anyone call Trump a racist for that. Calling the virus the "Chinese Virus" is a bit racist - especially coming for POTUS. He/she should be held to a higher standard than you and me IMO

President Trump was called a racist calling cov-19 the Chinese virus. I have never heard anyone called racist saying they ate Chinese food.

Sorry @AndrewYang I like what you've accomplished, but asking AsianAmericans to change our actions to reduce #Covid19 hate crimes means racists get to decide what's acceptable, and who gets in the club. Change the club. #WashTheHate
